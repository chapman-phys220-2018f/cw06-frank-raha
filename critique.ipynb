    "Organized although variables are not uniquely labeled and there are no comments. Other than this the code can be followed if I go through slowly and take my time at each step. Code could be improved if 'i' was iterated over a range instead of sqrt(x) and then having to define rules for numbers 2 and 3. I think this would make the code has less steps per iteration.\n",
